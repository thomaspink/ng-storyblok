# Serializer

## What is a Serializer?
The Serializer normalizes and serializes Data. 
Normalizing transforms Data from a simple form like a JSON Structure or a string to a more high level class based one.
Serializing does that in reverse. It transfors high level data to a simple sturcture.

## Why do we need this?
As we are loading data (stories, components, bloks,..) from the Storyblok API in the form of a special JSON structure ...
